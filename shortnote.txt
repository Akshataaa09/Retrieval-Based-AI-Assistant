# Maintenance RAG Assistant – ShortNote

## Assumptions
- Documents are readable PDFs or TXT files with maintenance procedures.
- Users will ask maintenance-related, operational questions.
- Answers must be strictly based on uploaded documents; no external info.

## Trade-offs Considered
- Groq Free LLM chosen: free and easy to use, but smaller context window limits long answers.
- Chunk size: 1000 characters with 200-character overlap balances retrieval speed vs context completeness.
- FAISS local vector store: simple and fast for small datasets, but not cloud-scalable.

## Improvements for Production
- Use a cloud-based vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate) for scalability and persistence.
- Add multi-turn conversational memory for follow-up questions.
- Integrate OCR to handle scanned PDF documents.
- Implement confidence scoring for retrieved answers.
- Add user authentication and logging for enterprise usage.
